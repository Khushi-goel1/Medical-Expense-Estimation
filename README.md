# Medical Expense Prediction using Linear Regression

## Problem Statement
ACME Insurance Inc. offers affordable health insurance to thousands of customers throughout the United States. As the lead data scientist at ACME, you're tasked with creating an automated system to estimate the annual medical expenditure for new customers based on various attributes, including age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region of residence.

## Overview
This project involves the development of a predictive model to estimate medical expenses using linear regression. The data was sourced from a publicly available dataset and is analyzed through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization before being used to train the linear regression model.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of 1338 entries with the following features:

- **age**: Age of the customer
- **sex**: Gender of the customer (male/female)
- **bmi**: Body Mass Index
- **children**: Number of children/dependents covered by health insurance
- **smoker**: Smoking habits (yes/no)
- **region**: Region of residence (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest)
- **charges**: Annual medical charges (target variable)
